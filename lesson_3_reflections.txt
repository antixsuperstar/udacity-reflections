When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It'd become useful when I need access from another computer, or maybe sharing a proyect
  with someone else, without having to set up a remote server.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  So every commit still means a new feature, some logical change, which is what a commit
  is intended to be.
